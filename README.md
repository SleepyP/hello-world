# hello-world

Greetings,

So, I want to code. I love computers, software, and knowing how it all works. I am currently going to school for a degree in database design and management. I'm hoping to speed up the process and learn some simple stuff here from anyone that is willing to help! I have so many ideas, but no experience. See you all out there!
